An All Carbon Free Path estimates when and how we reach Year Carbon Zero by simulating multiple CleanTechs together. As new CleanTechs are invented and manufactured over the next decade, a Path can show the impact for each one.

## File Descriptions
The main calculator is included along with constants used and input carbon emission data.
allcarbonfree_calcs.py – Simulator used to calculate a Path with multiple CleanTechs. 
constants.py – Constants used and sector categories
WRL_emissions.py – Used to create carbon emission values WRL_data.csv, which is comprised of EDGAR and OWID data.
## Ways to Contribute
